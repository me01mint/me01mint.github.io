   <h1>Polygon Labeling</h1>
   <h2>Problem 3, 2015</h2>
</body>
    <p><b><u>Background Information:</u></b><br>
    There are (n - 1)! ways to uniquely label the vertices of an n-gon. If  any labeling of an n-gon can be rotated to match a previous labeling, the labeling is not unique.  However, a labeling is unique, even if a reflection (or reflection followed by a rotation) of the labeling matches a previous labeling. For example, Figures 1 and 2 below are not uniquely labeled but Figures 1 and 3 are uniquely labeled. </p>

    <p>The Automated Testing Company needs a program that will input two lists of integers and determine if the second is (or is not)  a cycle of the first. If the second is a cycle of the first, then the two would not uniquely label an n-gon. Each list will contain between 3 and 20 positive integers. . Obviously, if different integers are used for the labeling, there is no cycle. The program will output the appropriate message of either CYCLE or NO CYCLE. </p>
    <p><b><u>Programming Problem:</u></b><br>
    Input:<br>
    A pos. integer 3 <= n <= 20 for the size of the n-gon followed by two labeling lists. 
Each list will consist of n positive integers.<br>
    Output:<br>
    Either "CYCLE" or "NO CYCLE".<br>
