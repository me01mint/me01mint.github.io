   <p><b><u>Background Information:</u></b><br>
   A very popular game is Four-Digit Number Cycler. In this game your opponent gives you a four-digit number (with at least two different digits) and you give your opponent a four-digit number (with at least two different digits). The first player to compute the number of cycles until repetition for his/her number is the winner. Cycles are described in the next paragraph. The game is mostly fair because every four-digit number (with at least two different digits) will reach a cycle of length one. </p>
   <p>CYCLES: Start with any four-digit number in which at least two of the digits are different. Put the digits in descending order to make one new four-digit number. Put the digits in ascending order to make a second new four-digit number. Include leading zeros if necessary. Subtract the second number from the first to form a new number. Apply the process until the new number is the same as the previous one.
<br><br>
For example, if your starting number is 7213, the following computations are executed:

<p>In this example, eight subtractions were required to find a cycle of length one.<br>
From the above example it can be observed if your starting number is 7641 (or any permutation of the digits 7641) then the number subtractions needed (to determine a cycle of length one) is 2.<br>
If you start with a four-digit number that does not have at least two different digits then the number of necessary subtractions will be 2. <br>
